    <h2><strong>Article 1:</strong></h2>
    <p><a href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/tobacco-nicotine-e-cigarettes/what-are-electronic-cigarettes">What are Electronic Cigarettes?</a></p>
    <p>E-cigarettes (electronic nicotine delivery systems) emerged in the U.S. market in 2007 and have rapidly grown in popularity. E-cigarettes, or e-vaporizers, are devices that heat a liquid containing solvents, flavors, and often nicotine. Users inhale the resulting vapor. A variety of designs are available, some mimicking the look of traditional cigarettes.
        <br><br>
        Users report the belief that e-cigarette products are less harmful than traditional cigarettes, and many report using them to help quit smoking traditional cigarettes. The devices are sometimes marketed for this purpose, although it is not yet clear if e-cigarettes are effective smoking cessation aids
        <br><br>
        As with cigarette use, e-cigarette use is higher among people with mental health conditions—with 3.1 percent currently using compared with 1.1 percent of those without mental illness. It is also a concern that pregnant women are using e-cigarettes, as nicotine exposure during periods of developmental vulnerability (including prenatal development) has adverse health consequences.

    <h2><strong>Article 2:</strong></h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/10566#smoking-and-health">Smoking and Health</a></p>
    <p>How does tobacco use affect people's health? 
        <br><br>
        Every year, more than 480,000 people die in the U.S. due to tobacco-related diseases — around 1 in 5 of all deaths — according to the American Cancer Society. They also state that around half of people in the U.S. who keep smoking will die from smoking-related causes. Life expectancy is at least 10 years less for smokers compared with nonsmokers. The American Cancer Society states that smoking shortens lifespan by about 12 years in males and 11 years in females.
        <br><br>
        The CDC comment that smoking causes more deaths in the U.S. each year than the following combined:
        <ul>
            <li>Motor vehicle injuries</li>
            <li>Alcohol or illicit drug use</li>
            <li>Firearm-related incidents</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        Tobacco contains poisonous substances that affect people’s health. Two of these poisons are:
        <ul>
            <li>Carbon monoxide. Car exhaust fumes also produce this substance, and it is fatal in large doses. It replaces oxygen in the blood and starves the organs of oxygen, stopping them from functioning correctly.</li>
            <li>Tar. This is a sticky, brown substance that coats the lungs and affects breathing.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        While the statistics are alarming, it is important to bear in mind that giving up smoking reduces the risk of disease dramatically.

    <p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco">Tobacco Fact Sheet</a></p>
    <p>How to reduce the demand for tobacco?
        <br><br>
        <strong>Surveillance is key: </strong> is key: Good monitoring tracks the extent and character of the tobacco epidemic and indicates how best to tailor policies. 
        <br><br>
        <strong>Tobacco users need help to quit: </strong> Counseling and medication can more than double a tobacco user's chance of successful quitting.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Pictorial health warnings work:  </strong> Hard-hitting anti-tobacco mass media campaigns and pictorial health warnings prevent children and other vulnerable groups from taking up tobacco use, and increase the number of tobacco users who quit.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Bans on tobacco advertising lower consumption:  </strong> One third of countries (66), representing a quarter of the world's population, have completely banned all forms of Tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Taxes are effective in reducing tobacco use: </strong> Tobacco taxes are the most cost-effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among youth and low-income groups.
        <br><br>

    <p><a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/how-is-hiv-transmitted/">How Do You Get or Transmit HIV?</a></p>
    <p>You can only get HIV by coming into direct contact with certain body fluids from a person with HIV who has a detectable viral load. These fluids are:
        <ul>
            <li>Blood</li>
            <li>Semen (cum) and pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum)            </li>
            <li>Rectal fluids
            </li>
            <li>Vaginal fluids
            </li>
            <li>Breast milk
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        How is HIV Not Spread?
        <br><br>
        HIV is not spread by:
        <ul>
            <li>Air or water
            </li>
            <li>Mosquitoes, ticks, or other insects
            </li>
            <li>Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine that is not mixed with the blood of a person with HIV
            </li>
            <li>Shaking hands; hugging; sharing toilets; sharing dishes, silverware, or drinking glasses; or engaging in closed-mouth or “social” kissing with a person with HIV
            </li>
            <li>Drinking fountains</li>
            <li>Other sexual activities that don't involve the exchange of body fluids (for example, touching).            </li>
            <li>Donating blood  </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        HIV can't be passed through healthy, unbroken skin.

    <h2><strong>Article 5:</strong></h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-implant-nexplanon">What is the Birth Control Implant?</a></p>
    <p>The birth control implant (AKA Nexplanon) is a tiny, thin rod about the size of a matchstick. The implant releases hormones into your body that prevent you from getting pregnant. A nurse or doctor inserts the implant into your arm and that’s it — you’re protected from pregnancy for up to 5 years. It’s get-it-and-forget-it birth control.
    <br><br>
    The hormones in the birth control implant prevent pregnancy in two ways:
    <ul>
        <li>Progestin thickens the mucus on your cervix, which stops sperm from swimming through to your egg. When sperm can't meet up with an egg, pregnancy can't happen.
        </li>
        <li>Progestin can also stop eggs from leaving your ovaries (called ovulation), so there’s no egg to fertilize. When eggs aren't released, you can't get pregnant.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    Here are the facts about the birth control implant: 
    <ul>
        <li>99% effective        </li>
        <li>Costs up to $1,300, but can be $0        </li>
        <li>Put in by a doctor or nurse        </li>
        <li>Lasts up to 5 years        </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Article 6:</strong></h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom">Do Condoms Protect Against all STIs?</a></p>
    <p>Condoms help protect against all STIs, but they provide more protection from some STDs than others.
        <br><br>
        There are lots of different STIs. Some are carried in body fluids like semen (cum), vaginal fluids, and blood — these include HIV, gonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis B, and trichomoniasis. Others can be passed from skin-to-skin touching with an infected body area, like your mouth or genitals — these include herpes, HPV and genital warts, syphilis, public lice (crabs), and scabies.
        <br><br>
        If you use condoms correctly, they work very well to prevent STIs that are carried in body fluids. But condoms are a little less effective at preventing skin-to-skin STIs — that's because these infections can sometimes live on areas of the body that condoms don't block, like the scrotum, upper thighs, buttocks (butt cheeks), and labia. For example, if someone has herpes sores or genital warts on their scrotum or around the base of their penis where a condom doesn't reach, they could give the infection to their partner during sex.
        <br><br>
        This may sound scary, but it's important to remember that most skin-to-skin STIs aren't dangerous and don't cause serious health problems. And all STIs can be treated or managed with medication — that's why STI testing is so important, so you can get treatment right away if you do happen to have an STI.

    <h2><strong>Article 7:</strong></h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/infertility">How long should women try to get pregnant before calling their doctors?</a></p>
    <p>Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after one year of trying (or six months if a woman is 35 or older). Women who can get pregnant but are unable to stay pregnant may also be infertile. About 10 percent of women (6.1 million) in the United States ages 15-44 have difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
<br><br>
How long should women try to get pregnant before calling their doctors? Most experts suggest at least one year. Women 35 or older should see their doctors after six months of trying. A woman's chances of having a baby decrease rapidly every year after the age of 30.
<br><br>
Some health problems also increase the risk of infertility. So, women should talk to their doctors if they have:
<ul>
    <li>Irregular periods or no menstrual periods
    </li>
    <li>Very painful periods
    </li>
    <li>Endometriosis   </li>
    <li>Pelvic inflammatory disease
    </li>
    <li>More than one miscarriage</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
It is a good idea for any woman to talk to a doctor before trying to get pregnant. Doctors can help you get your body ready for a healthy baby. They can also answer questions on fertility and give tips on conceiving.

    <h2><strong>Article 8:</strong></h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/compulsive-sexual-behavior/symptoms-causes/syc-20360434?p=1">What is Compulsive Sexual Behavior?</a></p>
    <p>Compulsive sexual behavior is sometimes called hypersexuality or sexual addiction. It's an intense focus on sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors that can't be controlled. This causes distress and problems for your health, job, relationships or other parts of your life.
        <br><br>
        Compulsive sexual behavior may involve different kinds of commonly enjoyable sexual experiences. Examples include masturbation, sexual arousal by using a computer to communicate, multiple sexual partners, use of pornography or paying for sex. But when these sexual behaviors become a major, constant focus in your life, are difficult to control, cause problems in your life, or are harmful to you or others, that's likely compulsive sexual behavior.
        <br><br>
        No matter what it's called or the exact nature of the behavior, untreated compulsive sexual behavior can damage your self-esteem, relationships, career, health and other people. But with treatment and self-help, you can learn to manage compulsive sexual behavior.
        <br><br>
        Symptoms
        <br><br>
        Some signs that you may have compulsive sexual behavior include:
        <ul>
            <li>You have repeated and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors that take up a lot of your time and feel as if they're beyond your control.
            </li>
            <li>You feel driven or have frequent urges to do certain sexual behaviors, feel a release of the tension afterward, but also feel guilt or deep regret.
            </li>
            <li>You've tried without success to reduce or control your sexual fantasies, urges or behavior.
            </li>
            <li>You use compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from other problems, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress.
            </li>
            <li>You continue to engage in sexual behaviors in spite of them causing serious problems. These could include the possibility of getting or giving someone else a sexually transmitted infection, the loss of important relationships, trouble at work, financial issues, or legal problems.
            </li>
            <li>You have trouble making and keeping healthy and stable relationships.            </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Article 9:</strong></h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/sexual-health#tab=tab_1">What is Sexual Health and Well-being?</a></p>
    <p>Sexual health is fundamental to the overall health and well-being of individuals, couples and families, and to the social and economic development of communities and countries. Sexual health, when viewed affirmatively, requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. The ability of men and women to achieve sexual health and well-being depends on their:
        <ul>
            <li>You have repeated and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors that take up a lot of your time and feel as if they're beyond your control.
            </li>
            <li>You feel driven or have frequent urges to do certain sexual behaviors, feel a release of the tension afterward, but also feel guilt or deep regret.
            </li>
            <li>access to comprehensive, good-quality information about sex and sexuality;
            </li>
            <li>knowledge about the risks they may face and their vulnerability to adverse consequences of unprotected sexual activity;
            </li>
            <li>ability to access sexual health care;
            </li>
            <li>living in an environment that affirms and promotes sexual health.            </li>
